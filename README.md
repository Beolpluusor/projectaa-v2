my very first project that is Finished.

point of this was to learn how to make react based webpage and how does an arcade game site could work.

I have used AI (copilot) on building this website, reason for that was to get fast onward to see how i manage the communication of backend and frontend.
even with the help of copilot there was somethings that wasn't easy. like making querys with database.


there is database import file inside the project folder where you can do the database.
some users and gamescores have been added to database to see how it shows the data in website.

feel free to study if you are exploring the react world as I do. 

making documentation and uploading it here when its finished.

been a very good project for me, now I know how to do a database, frontend, backend.
