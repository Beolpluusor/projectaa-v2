my very first project that is Finished.

point of this was to learn how to make react based webpage and how does an arcade game site could work.
there is database import file inside the project folder where you can do the database.
some users and gamescores have been added to database to see how it shows the data in website.

feel free to study if you are exploring the react world as I do. 

making documentation and uploading it here when its finished.
